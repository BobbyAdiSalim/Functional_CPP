This is a short article about modern functional features in C++ with some example codes.

There is one bad example of code that won't compile: no-capture.cpp
There are two files that uses features from C++20 (ranges-filter.cpp and ranges-transform.cpp) and should be compiled with:
g++ -Wall -std=c++20 -o ranges-filter.exe ranges-filter.cpp
g++ -Wall -std=c++20 -o ranges-transform.exe ranges-transform.cpp

Unless specified otherwise in this file, all source code are compiled using C++17 (default standard for GCC 11 and later) with the following command:
g++ -Wall -o "file-name.exe" "file-name.cpp"
or, to specify the standard:
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o "file-name.exe" "file-name.cpp"
